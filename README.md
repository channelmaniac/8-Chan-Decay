# 8-Chan-Decay

This is a front panel PCB for the 8-Channel Decay for Eurorack I picked up from a Reddit user. 

Feel free to make them, modify them, love them, hate them, etc... I just thought I'd share. 

Made with Front Panel Designer then exported to DXF for import into KiCAD for silkscreen and gerber generation

I used JCLPCB for this and many other projects and have been extremely satisfied with them. YMMV with different PCB makers.
